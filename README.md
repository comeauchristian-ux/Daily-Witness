# Daily Witness

Daily Witness is a quiet instrument for recording presence across the day.

It is not a habit tracker. It does not measure performance, progress, or completion. It simply records whether certain modes of presence were inhabited.

The day is structured into four equal domains:

**Inner**
- Morning Prayer
- Gratitude
- Evening Prayer

**Reception**
- Scripture
- Silence
- Study

**Outer**
- Outdoors
- Movement
- Care

**Expression**
- Charity
- Initiation
- Recollection

Each item can be marked once per day. Over time, these marks form a stitched tapestry — a visual record of lived presence.

## Philosophy

Daily Witness is based on four movements:

- turning inward  
- receiving what is given  
- inhabiting the world bodily  
- returning outward consciously  

It avoids streaks, scores, totals, or completion states. Absence is as legitimate as presence. The app records witness, not achievement.

## Interface

The primary interface is a circle divided into four quadrants, like a clock. Each quadrant represents one domain. Stitches appear along the circle as items are marked.

History appears as a woven tapestry of days.
